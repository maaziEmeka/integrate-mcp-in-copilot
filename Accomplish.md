# Integrate MCP with GitHub Copilot

- Setup and configure Model Context Protocol (MCP) server with GitHub Copilot
- Use MCP to extend Copilot's capabilities beyond just code completion
- Integrate GitHub MCP server for seamless repository management
- Use Copilot Agent mode with external tool permissions
- Research and compare similar projects using Copilot with MCP tools
- Implement feature requests by having Copilot create GitHub issues automatically
- Use Copilot to triage, prioritize, and solve existing repository issues
- Create pull requests and manage repository workflows through Copilot
- Validate and review AI-generated code changes
- Learn about FastAPI web application development for school management systems

## Key Technologies Learned

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Universal connector for AI tools ("USB-C for AI")
- **GitHub MCP Server**: Provides GitHub API access through MCP interface
- **GitHub Copilot Agent Mode**: Enhanced Copilot with external tool integrations
- **FastAPI**: Python web framework for building APIs
- **VS Code Extensions**: Copilot Chat, Python extension integration
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Cloud development environment setup

## Practical Skills Developed

- Configuring `.vscode/mcp.json` for MCP server integration
- Using natural language to interact with external services through Copilot
- Managing GitHub repositories (issues, PRs, branches) via AI assistance
- Implementing authentication systems (login/logout functionality)
- Building web applications for educational institutions
- Code review and validation practices for AI-generated code
- Understanding permission models for AI tool access

## Project Context

Built a school management system for **Mergington High School** extracurricular activities, allowing students to:
- View available activities (Chess Club, Programming Class, Gym Class, etc.)
- Sign up for activities with email registration
- Manage participation limits and scheduling
- Handle teacher authentication and admin controls
