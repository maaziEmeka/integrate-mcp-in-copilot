# Changes Made to Implement Authentication

## Problem Statement
The repository had partially implemented authentication code that was broken due to syntax errors. The task was to fix these issues and complete the authentication implementation.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Backend (app.py) - Syntax Errors
**Problem**: The file had severe syntax errors:
- Missing `app = FastAPI(...)` declaration
- Login/logout endpoints were incorrectly placed inside the activities dictionary definition
- This made the file unparseable by Python

**Fix**:
- Added proper `app = FastAPI(...)` declaration at the top
- Moved login/logout endpoints to the correct location after the activities dictionary
- Restructured the file to have proper Python syntax

### 2. Backend - Form Data Handling
**Problem**: Login endpoint expected form data but FastAPI didn't have the necessary dependency to parse it

**Fix**:
- Added `Form` import from `fastapi`
- Changed login function signature to use `Form(...)` for username and password parameters
- Added `python-multipart` to requirements.txt

### 3. Frontend (styles.css) - CSS Specificity Issue
**Problem**: The `.hidden` class wasn't hiding elements because `#user-info { display: flex; }` had higher specificity

**Fix**:
- Added `!important` to `.hidden { display: none !important; }` to ensure it always takes precedence

### 4. Frontend (app.js) - JavaScript Typo
**Problem**: Missing closing bracket in button selector: `"button[type='submit'"` instead of `"button[type='submit']"`

**Fix**:
- Fixed the selector to `"button[type='submit']"` in both places (lines 21 and 26)

### 5. Frontend - UX Improvement
**Problem**: Login form fields retained values after logout

**Fix**:
- Added `loginForm.reset()` in the logout handler to clear username/password fields

## Files Modified

1. **src/app.py**
   - Fixed syntax errors
   - Added Form dependency
   - Properly structured endpoints

2. **src/static/app.js**
   - Fixed button selector typo
   - Added form reset on logout

3. **src/static/styles.css**
   - Fixed hidden class with !important

4. **requirements.txt**
   - Added python-multipart dependency

5. **AUTHENTICATION.md** (new)
   - Comprehensive documentation of the authentication feature
   - Security notes and warnings
   - Test credentials

6. **screenshots/** (new directory)
   - 5 screenshots demonstrating the authentication flow

## Testing Performed

✅ Backend server starts without errors
✅ Login endpoint accepts form data correctly
✅ Logout endpoint clears session and cookie
✅ Signup endpoint requires authentication
✅ Unregister endpoint requires authentication
✅ Frontend login form shows/hides correctly
✅ Frontend logout button shows/hides correctly
✅ Sign Up button enables/disables based on auth state
✅ Both teacher and student accounts work
✅ Sessions persist across page operations
✅ Logout clears session properly

## Test Accounts

- **Teacher**: username `teacher`, password `teachpass`
- **Student**: username `student`, password `studpass`

## Security Notes

This is a basic demonstration implementation with known limitations:
- Plain text password storage
- In-memory session storage (lost on restart)
- No HTTPS requirement
- No rate limiting
- No CSRF protection

For production use, these issues must be addressed.
